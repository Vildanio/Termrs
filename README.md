# Termrs

Termrs is a Rust crate tailored for crafting cross-platform terminal user interfaces (TUI). Built on the foundation of the `crossterm` crate for efficient terminal interaction, Termrs aspires to simplify TUI development in Rust. With a straightforward architecture, Termrs aims to provide an experience reminiscent of WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation), making terminal UI development accessible, even for those familiar with desktop GUI frameworks. **Please note that Termrs is in its early stages of development**.

## Features

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Develop terminal applications that seamlessly run across diverse operating systems, leveraging Rust's cross-platform capabilities and the robust `crossterm` crate.

- **WPF-Inspired Architecture**: Enjoy a terminal UI development experience that mirrors the simplicity and expressiveness of WPF, allowing developers to quickly adapt to building TUI applications.

- **Powered by `crossterm`**: Benefit from the capabilities of the `crossterm` crate for reliable and platform-agnostic terminal interactions.
